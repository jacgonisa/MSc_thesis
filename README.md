# MetEOr: Metagenomic-driven Enzymatic Ortholog discovery

![MetEOr Logo](MetEOr_logo.png)

MetEOr is an innovative pipeline for discovering enzymatic orthologs using metagenomic data. Developed as part of a Master's thesis, this project aims to streamline the identification and analysis of enzymatic orthologs from complex metagenomic datasets.

## üöÄ Features

- Automated processing of metagenomic data
- Identification of enzymatic orthologs
- Network-based analysis of enzyme relationships
- Phylogenetic tree construction and annotation
- Integration with KEGG Orthology (KO) database

## üìÅ Repository Structure
- `emap_env.yml`: Conda environment file for eggNOG-mapper dependencies.
- `ete_diamond_env.yml`: Conda environment file for ETE Toolkit and DIAMOND dependencies.
- `KOs_ids.txt`: Input file containing KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers for analysis.
- `main_script.py`: The primary Python script for the pipeline.
- `bin/`:
  SLURM scripts for job submission in a cluster environment:

  - `KO2fasta.slurm`: Step 1 - Retrieve homologous sequences
  - `treebuilder.slurm`: Step 2 - Build tree and identify candidate enzymes
  - `SSN.slurm`: Step 3 - Build 	Sequence Similarity Networks (SSN)
  - `emapper.slurm`: Step 4 - Functional annotation of sequences
  - `treeannotator.slurm` -: Step 5 - Tree annotation
    
  Python scripts launched dependent on SLURM scripts:

  - `build_network.py`: Builds a network for enzymatic ortholog analysis.
  - `build_network_structure.py`: Structures or extends the network built by `build_network.py`.
  - `clean_diamond.py`: Cleans up data using the Diamond tool.
  - `filter_by_length.py`: Filters sequences based on length criteria.
  - `get_seqs_by_ko_hit.py`: Retrieves sequences based on hits to KEGG Orthology (KO).
  - `identify_clusters_net.py`: Identifies clusters within a network context.
  - `identify_clusters_structural.py`: Identifies structural clusters or patterns.
  - `midpoint_tree.py`: Constructs midpoint trees for phylogenetic analysis.
  - `plot_algorithm.py`: Generates plots related to algorithms or data analysis results.
  - `threshold_algorithm.py`: Implements algorithms with specified thresholds.
  - `trim_alignment.py`: Trims sequence alignments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

MetEOr is designed to be run in an HPC cluster. Detailed installation instructions will be provided as the project progresses. We plan to implement it in Nextflow or distribute it via a Singularity container.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- SLURM in HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster to run the programme.

## üìò Usage

Comprehensive usage instructions and examples will be added as the project develops. The pipeline will be designed for ease of use in both local and cluster environments.
