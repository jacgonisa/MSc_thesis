# MetEOr: Metagenomic-driven Enzymatic Ortholog discovery

![MetEOr Logo](MetEOr_logo.png)

MetEOr is an innovative pipeline for discovering enzymatic orthologs using metagenomic data. Developed as part of a Master's thesis, this project aims to streamline the identification and analysis of enzymatic orthologs from complex metagenomic datasets.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated processing of metagenomic data
- Identification of enzymatic orthologs
- Network-based analysis of enzyme relationships
- Phylogenetic tree construction and annotation
- Integration with KEGG Orthology (KO) database


## 🛠️ Installation

MetEOr is designed to be run in an HPC cluster. Detailed installation instructions will be provided as the project progresses. We plan to implement it in Nextflow or distribute it via a Singularity container.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- SLURM in HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster to run the programme.

## 📘 Usage

Comprehensive usage instructions and examples will be added as the project develops. The pipeline will be designed for ease of use in both local and cluster environments.
