# MetEOr (Metagenomic-driven Enzymatic Ortholog discovery)

MetEOr is an ongoing project aimed at developing a pipeline for discovering enzymatic orthologs using metagenomic data. This pipeline is being developed as part of a Master's thesis and will be shared and implemented using Singularity or Nextflow.
